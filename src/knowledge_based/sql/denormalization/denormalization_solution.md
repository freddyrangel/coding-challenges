# DENORMALIZATION

## Question

What is denormalization? Explain the pros and cons.

## Solution

In database design, denormalization is the process of adding redundancy to a
database by incorporating data from multiple tables into a single table. This is
typically done to improve the performance of database queries, particularly in
situations where a normalized database structure would require a large number of
joins to retrieve the necessary data.

One of the main advantages of denormalization is that it can significantly
improve the performance of certain types of queries. By eliminating the need for
complex joins, denormalized tables can be accessed more quickly and with fewer
resources. This can be especially beneficial in situations where a database is
used to support real-time applications or high-concurrency environments.

On the other hand, denormalization has a number of potential drawbacks. One of
the main disadvantages is that it can increase the amount of data duplication in
a database, which can make it more difficult to maintain data integrity. This is
because any changes made to the data in a denormalized table must be manually
propagated to all the other copies of the data, which can be time-consuming and
error-prone. Additionally, denormalization can make it more difficult to add or
modify the structure of a database, as changes to one table can have unintended
consequences on other denormalized tables.

Overall, the decision to denormalize a database should be carefully considered,
as it can have both positive and negative impacts on the performance and
maintainability of a database.
